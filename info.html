            It must have come to one's notice that the chances of winning a car became significantly higher when the choice was changed rather than 
            keeping the same choice,but why is it so? The reason can be explained with conditional probability theorem.

                Conditioned probability as the name suggests is probability conditioned according to an event,in other words it defines how the 
                probability of an event occurring is defined provided that another event has already occurred.Let's take an example, on a given day 
                what is the probability that there are clouds in the sky ? Practically speaking we can estimate the chances by taking into account 
                the weather history of the area, the season ,whether there are clouds in the neighbouring areas or not. Mathematically there is no way
                to provide an accurate probability of such event. Now let's say another event has been confirmed to occur,it is raining in the area , now 
                certainly we can calculate probability of clouds being in the sky as 1 as it is not possible for rain to occur without clouds.

                Mathematically given an event B , probability of event A is calculated as probability of events A and B occurring together divided by the
                probability of event B.

            To demonstrate how switching the choice maximises chances of victory we will calculate probability of winning in both cases whether we
            switch our choice or not and compare the probability of winning in both the cases.
